        <h2>The greatest city in the world</h2>
        <p>Baltimore -- the colorful, diverse city that is Maryland's largest city and economic hub, is known for its beautiful harbor and quirky, distinct neighborhoods. With the rich history the city boasts, it's amazing that Baltimore hasn't been deemed one of America's greatest historical destinations.</p>

        <h2>Patterson Park</h2>
        <p>It's no wonder that new residents and longtime Baltimoreans alike love Patterson Park. That Southern Living magazine ranked us among the nation's top "comeback" neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>And that the Baltimore Business Journal has recognized Patterson Park as one of Baltimore's hottest neighborhoods for buying a new home. Patterson Park is a special place that's moving into the future while keeping its best traditions from the past — friends, family and community.</p>

        <h2>Mount Vernon</h2>
        <p>With a backdrop of stunning 19th century architecture and inviting parks, Baltimore’s Mount Vernon is a cultural urban village that boasts museums, music, theater, international dining cuisine, boutiques, festivals, and a thriving nightlife.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood’s historic centerpiece, built in 1815, is the Washington Monument. The nation’s first monument to George Washington soars 176 feet above four picturesque parks. Mount Vernon is a special place, rich in history and vibrant in the present, a neighborhood that beckons residents and visitors to take their time and enrich their lives.</p>

        <h2>Hampden</h2>
        <p>No neighborhood says “Bawlmer” quite like north Baltimore’s Hampden, a 19th-century blue-collar mill town that has evolved into the epicenter of hipster Baltimore kitsch.</p>
        <p>Made famous for its starring role in John Waters’ films and long known as the place where everybody calls you “hon,” Hampden centers on 36th Street – known to locals simply as the Avenue. You’ll find original shops and an eccentric array of cafes mingling with the barber shops and pharmacies that keep this authentic, hardworking neighborhood real.</p>

        <h2>Fells Point</h2>
        <p>Fell's Point is a spirited waterfront community in perpetual celebration of Baltimore's British nautical roots.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood's visage has remained largely unchanged since its founding and attracts many visitors. Explore the 18th- and 19th-century homes and storefronts – most were once one of the "three B's": boarding houses, brothels and bars. Chesapeake Bay cuisine is at its best here too, whether you crave oysters on the half shell at a local pub, or fresh seafood at an upscale restaurant.</p>

        <h2>Harbor East</h2>
        <p>Harbor East is the new and evolving Baltimore neighborhood that is redefining city life and expanding the notion of the urban experience.</p>
        <p>Situated on a spectacular stretch of waterfront just east of the Inner Harbor and just west of historic Fell’s Point, Harbor East is a place where residents, retailers, businesses and visitors collide, creating a vibrant and bustling epicenter.</p>

        <h2>Mount Washington</h2>
        <p>Visit historic Mt. Washington Village, an extraordinary destination where fond memories are made. Nestled in the northwestern nook of Baltimore City, its colorful, historic charm exudes the warm qualities of the old world summer getaway for which it is famed.</p>
        <p>Nostagic, yet distinct, familiar and luxurious, the Village's boutiques, salons, galleries, restaurants and cafes are set amid a stunning landscape of gently wooded hills, old trees and a glistening stream. There's no other neighborhood like it.</p>
